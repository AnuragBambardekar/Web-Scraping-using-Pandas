# Web-Scraping-using-Pandas
Scraped a Wikipedia page and plotted the data collected and stored it in CSV <br>

The goal is to collect some data from the Internet (Wikipedia) for a Machine Learning Project. <br>
Learned to scrape data using pandas library's read_html function. <br><br>
This function searches for <table> elements and only for <tr> and <th> rows and <td> elements within each <tr> or <th> element in the table. <br>
Fetched list of cricket records from Wikipedia, specifically most career runs scored, plotted it and stored it in CSV for further use. <br>
